# Hackathon Site Template

## How to Get Started
Edit `site.json`. For the `body` section, Github-Flavored Markdown *is* supported. We also support Github-Flavored (and Discord and Slack-Flavored) Emojis. This means you can type `:sparkling-heart:` and it will render a ðŸ’– on your site.
> Be sure to add a `favicon.ico` to the `/public` directory!

## Templating
Here's how I've structured it.
`"Heading": "Paragraph text after this"`
Please do not use `# `, `## `, `### `, etc. This will either not work or break the site.

## Hosting
You can host this site for FREE on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). If you need help hosting this, please schedule a meeting with me or DM me on a social network or Hack Club slack.
